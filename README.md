# Get_Next_Line
Created at 42, the goal of this project was to create a function that return the next line of a text. 
It can get tough when the allocation is not exactly as long as the buffer size.

# How to try?
Clone the repo, call the function and add the include needed. Use this function in a loop with a file descriptor.
